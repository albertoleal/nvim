MIGRATING FROM LEGACY VIMFILE                             *vimfiles-migrating*
                                                                   *migrating*

If you're used to the legacy-vimfiles, there are a few things in this vim
config which may be unfamiliar. Here are the key differences, and why.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUICK DIFFERENCES

- Leader has changed from `,` to `<Space>`
- `:nohl` is no longer bound to `<Space>`. It's now `<Esc><Esc>`
- Running tests was `,t`. Now try `<Space>tf`
- `<C-p>` used to run a fuzzy matcher.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHILOSOPHY

This config (currently available at https://github.com/luan/nvim) is intended
to be a bit more "pure" than legacy-vimfiles (currently available at
https://github.com/luan/vimfiles).
The idea is to not override defaults unless absolutely
necessary. This should make it easier to migrate back and forth between this
config, other vim configs, and vanilla vim/vi.  For this reason, features
added are exclusively additive to the standard Vim experience.
